    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",

    "**Answer:** (Write answer, here)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I've made quite big change on the whole model, where I changed the model training to be similar with the CharRNN, where instead of training the RNN to predict the next word based on a given length of sequence (the original design of this project's notebook), I changed it to predict the next word based on the last seen word and all the previous words that the LSTM has seen so far without any limit of the sequence length (based on the buildup of the hidden states of LSTMs). This is done by doing the batching of data and training to be similar with how the CharRNN is trained in one of the exercise notebooks in \"Implementation of RNN & LSTM\" course, which I think is better suited for solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence length hence does not really matter in this case. This is because of the way I batch the data (which follows how CharRNN did the batching). With the new way of batching, sequence_length is more like the \"batch size\" in which the RNN train with within a single iteration. What matters is the batch_size now, a.k.a. the number of sequences within a single batch. Why? This is because, if you see the training code, at the beginning of each epoch, the hidden states of the LSTMs are initialized following the batch_size, then the hidden states are build up after each iteration within the whole epoch (and only reset at beginning of next epoch). Also note that I've changed the batching behavior so that it is similar with how the batching is done in the CharRNN case, where first the whole \"training data\" sequence is divided into batch_size number of sequences with equal lengths, then only the batching code goes through those long sequences sequence_length at a time. I copied the image below for illustration.\n",
    "![](assets/sequence_batching.png)\n",
    "So, if for example the batch_size is 5, then the hidden states are initialized for \"5 independent sequences\". This means that, the whole Seinfeild script is like divided into 5 long sequences of equal length, and the RNN is then trained on those 5 long sequences, where the hidden states of LSTM are build up on those 5 long sequences independently in each epoch of the training. So here in this case it is the \"batch_size\" that determines the length of the sequence within which the RNN is trained on, where lower batch_size means the whole script is divided into less number of sequences, and hence, the resulting length of each independent sequence is longer with smaller batch_size. That is why I chose batch_size=5, because then the RNN will be trained on 5 independent sequences which are about 178422 long for each sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the other hyperparameters, I just chose them based on best practices, where n_layers I chose as 3 to be able to capture more complexity of the script, number of hidden_dim=256 to be not too large but not too small (because usually the hidden dim is around 128, 256, or 512, so I just picked a middle ground here). I also picked the embedding size to be 300 which is the common choice (I can increase it in the hope that more variations of wordings will be used by the model). Number of epochs = 100 because that was my initial choice, where I left my model to train during sleep. After seeing the result, it seems that 50 epochs is already enough. Learning rate I chose to be 0.001 which is my go to learning rate, and I saw that the loss decrease quite in stable manner with this learning rate, so I keep that value."
